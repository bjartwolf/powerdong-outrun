Based on the Outrun clone by Copyright (c) 2018 Nathaniel Wroblewski
and adapted with new sound and graphics for Powerdong.

Running locally

Clone the repo, and run a server:

$ cd outrun
$ python -m http.server
```

Some todos
- Buildscript with autoreload (vite)
- Some tests perhaps
- Consider typescript...
- Decide on art style for the truck
- Find a color palette
- Naive high score system
- Break and turn should shift weight forwards and give a cool effect
- Look at gifs to get card skidding effects on sprites - check feasabilty
